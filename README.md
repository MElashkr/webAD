# webAD
Built on the MVC architectural pattern webAD visualizes algorithms and data structures. All JS files are in the 'libs' directory.

Logic is located in 'models' folder, drawings are in the 'views'

Following algorithms and data structures are visualized:
* Bubble/Selection/Merge/(Binary) Quick/LSD Radix/Bucket/Counting Sort
* Double/Linear/Extendible Hashing, Linear Probing, Separate Chaining, BISEH
* Breadth/Depth First Search, Kruskal, Dijkstra, Prim, Topological Sort and Floyd-Warshall Algorithms
* Binary Search Tree, B+ Tree, Binary Min Heap, Heap Sort, Trie, Traversal, 2-3-4 Tree

To start the visualization just open the 'index.html' in the 'htmls' folder

Tape-Recorder provides flexible switching of animation
